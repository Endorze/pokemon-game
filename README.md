This is the start of my own pokemon-fanmade game, in the future pokemon will be replaced by my ownmade monsters/heroes, but for now i'm sticking to pokemon.

To play you must start game, go through dialogue.
Movement:

Key a = go left;
Key d = go right;

To play pokemon battles you simply go all the way to the right, go through the Wilderness arrowsign.
To run from battle simply press run and confirm, go back the same way if you wish to battle again.

The battles are at the moment INFINITE, so exit when you feel finished.
